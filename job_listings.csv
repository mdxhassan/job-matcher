CTO & Co-Founder,Emploai.io,Aarhus,Cofounder,"Ready for a pivotal role in a tech startup with high ambitions to make a significant difference - internationally?
At Emploai, we aim to create the future workforce for B2B companies, both nationally and internationally. Currently, we're looking for a dedicated and experienced Tech Lead/CTO who will be a central driving force in building and scaling Emploai and our first AI-powered digital worker (Alex, the SDR)

About Emploai:
Scaling a business is hard. Most people would agree to this, and the ""old ways"" of doing things are both expensive, non-reliable and not very scalable. According to Hubspot, 61% of B2B marketers cite generating high-quality leads as their biggest challenge, and the option for solving this problem is usually hiring more SDRs (Sales development representatives). However, this comes with a range of issues:
They are very expensive...
The good ones are hard to come by...
They take a while to hire...
Furthermore, the average human-SDR only spends 28% of their week actually selling. At Emploai, we believe this number should be a lot closer to 100%.

Now imagine Employees (Emploai´s), that work for you 27/7/365, never miss a beat, get smarter over time and are cheaper and faster to hire. The first of these AI-powered digital workers is""Alex"", who is...:
Trained in every step of the top-of-funnel strategy for a B2B company
Fully automized (So little to no work needed for the customer)
Multilingual, and will expand to every market with you!

And he has already:
Booked +2000 sales calls for our partners
Generated over 10.000.000€ in extra pipeline value for our partners
Increased yearly revenue by 1.600.000€ for our partners

About the Role:
This essential role emerges at a critical juncture, aligning perfectly with Emploai´s preparations for a substantial growth phase. You will actively contribute to shaping the core elements of both the product and the company during this defining stage.
Own and communicate product strategy, data strategy, architecture, and tech stack
Build and maintain a robust and scalable platform
Translate customer needs into roadmaps for internal and external developers, designers, and data specialists
Prioritize, plan, and be responsible for delivery - but also be hands-on and code the platform itself
Own and continuously improve data flow, database, and performance
Utilize data and predictive models to enhance products and services
Participate in company strategy, go-to-market, fundraising, organizational development, etc.

About You:
You not only have significant technical expertise across software development, data, and ideally AI, but are also passionate about making a difference. You have a problem-solving mindset, and a drive to figure out things you don’t yet know.
Solid experience leading technical resources and projects
Experience from startups/scale-ups, and thrive in a hectic environment
Deeply engaged in user experience and curious about new technologies
Strong collaboration skills, great at building trust with internal and external stakeholders
Handle complexity, uncertainty, and time pressure well, comfortable making difficult decisions and prioritizing to achieve the best result

Why Emploai?:
Key role in building and scaling a product of societal value
Opportunity to join an ambitious team at an early stage
Ownership in the company
Flexibility - yes, you often have to roll up your sleeves, but you also get flexibility in return

Ready to dive in and join us on this exciting journey? Then we want to hear from you.

ØNSK søger en passioneret Marketing Manager, der vil stå i spidsen for vores vision om at kombinere velsmagende kaffe med en positiv indvirkning på verden. I 2023 omsatte vi for 20 mio - og i 2026 omsætter vi for 100 mio, og det er den rejse, vi har brug for dig til.
Hos ØNSK er vi i gang med at ændre kaffeindustrien. Siden 2017 har vi arbejdet direkte og uden mellemled med kaffebønder i Nicaragua og Peru for at fremme et regenerativt og økologisk skovkaffesystem. Vores indsats har allerede resulteret i 70% CO2-besparelser og øget bøndernes betaling med 45%. ØNSK leverer i dag kaffe til over 800 virksomheder, og vi er på en mission om at inspirere både forbrugere og virksomheder til at vælge en grønnere og mere bæredygtig kaffe.

Om rollen:
Som Marketing Manager får du ansvaret for vores marketingafdeling, som består af to dygtige kollegaer. Du vil både udvikle, og i høj grad være ansvarlig for at eksekvere på vores marketingstrategier. Du har altså både den strategiske hat på, men i høj grad også fingrene i bolledejen. Som strategisk sparring kommer du til at arbejde tæt sammen med ledelsesteamet og vores advisory board for Brand & Marketing.
ØNSK er i scaleup fasen, ligeså er vores marketing. Det betyder også at du har meget frie rammer, og vi omvendt også forventer du kan være i dette. Nedenfor er en ønskeliste - som jobopslag nu er - for os er det personligheden der er vigtigst, selvfølgelig med en faglig ballast.

Dine opgaver og ansvarsområder:
Lede og udvikle marketingafdelingen, herunder ansvaret for to medarbejdere - som vi på sigt håber kan blive endnu større.
Skabe og eksekvere marketingstrategier med fokus på lead-generering, paid social, e-mail marketing (gerne i Klaviyo) og organisk SOME
Samarbejde med eksterne leverandører om deres ydelser til os
Optimere UX og konvertering på vores hjemmeside www.onsk.dk
Supervisere content creation-opgaver, inklusiv foto- og videoredigering
Sparre med ledelsen og advisory board om brandudvikling og markedsføringsinitiativer

Vi søger en Marketing Manager, der (igen, husk det er en ønskeliste):
Er struktureret, løsningsorienteret og kreativ - ja, vi drømmer om en der kan alt
Har arbejdet med lead-generering til B2B
Har flair for at arbejde med content på sociale medier og elsker at eksekvere på idéer
Trives med ansvar og evner at tage ejerskab over opgaver - selvledelse er et must
Har erfaring fra en lignende stilling med paid social, PPC, SEO og e-mail marketing
Har lidt erfaring med ledelse og ønsker at udvikle sine evner her indenfor
Har arbejdet med FMCG eller brands

Vi tilbyder:
En alsidig hverdag i et ungt og uformelt, men ambitiøst arbejdsmiljø
Mulighed for personlig og faglig udvikling i samarbejde med vores ledelsesteam, bestyrelse og advisory board
Muligheden for at lede og udvide marketingteamet i takt med vores vækst
Løn fastsættes efter kvalifikationer. Vi har overenskomst. Oplys gerne forventet lønniveau i ansøgningen. Vi er stadigvæk en omkostningsbevidst virksomhed så forvent ikke vi sprænger lønrammerne.
På længere sigt, mulighed for at vokse ind i en rolle med endnu mere ansvar og evt. mulighed for investering i virksomheden.
Muligheden for at komme med til Nicaragua og/eller Peru for at besøge bønder og dokumentere vores impact-arbejde.

Ansøgning: Vi modtager mange ansøgninger, og hvis du vil skille dig ud, så vedhæft en kort video på maksimalt 2 minutter, hvor du kort fortæller om dig selv. Ansøgning sendes via the hub. Ansættelsesstart er fra november-december, og vi besvarer ansøgningerne i slutningen af september og vil derefter løbende holde samtaler.
