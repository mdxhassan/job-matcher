# Ethics Guidelines for AI Job Matcher

## 1. Data Collection and Privacy

- We only collect publicly available job listings from thehub.io and adhere to their terms of service (robots.txt).
- We do not collect or store any personal information from job seekers beyond their immediate input.
- User inputs (skills, strengths, and job preferences) are used solely for the purpose of job matching and are not stored after the session ends.

## 2. Transparency

- We clearly inform users that we are using AI technology (OpenAI's GPT model) to match them with job listings.
- We provide explanations for job recommendations to ensure transparency in the matching process.

## 3. Fairness and Non-Discrimination

- We regularly review and update our model to mitigate potential biases.

## 4. Data Accuracy

- We strive to ensure the accuracy of job listings by regularly updating our scraping process.

- We implement rate limiting in our web scraping to avoid overwhelming the source website (thehub.io).
